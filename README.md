# rDNA_blastn: Characterization of ribosomal DNA arrays in genomes or long-read sequencing data with integrated BLASTn

## 🧬 Ribosomal DNA arrays
The 45S ribosomal DNA unit is organized in a specific structure, with genes and internal and external spacers that composes a cluster that repeats tandemly and it is located in the nucleolar organizing regions (NORs). The ribosomal genes are highly conserved, specially the 5.8S, which is interesting to use as the BLASTn reference.

To see the cluster organization and structure, as well as the neighbouring regions to form longer arrays within the same region (scaffold or chromosome), this custom script performs, after the BLASTn search, a bidirectional extension in the hits on a value of preference by the user, just adjusting the value of base pairs that the script extend in both strands.

The script verifies overlapping regions . If the BLASTn hits of the reference input overlaps

## 🔍 BLASTn
This BLASTn (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool; Altschul et al., 1990) approach allows to search for any reference in complete genomes and/or raw long-read sequencing, which the parameters can be modified in a copy of the script to adapt to your targeted sequence and goals.
